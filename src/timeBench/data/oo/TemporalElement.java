/**
 * Class for Temporal Element.
 * 
 * Temporal Element is an interface based on the definition as 
 * a finite union of anchored primitives (Instant, Interval,
 * Indeterminate Instant, and Indeterminate Interval).
 * Therefore, to create instances, one of those primitves has to
 * be used.
