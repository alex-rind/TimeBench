{"name":"Timebench","tagline":"foundational data structures and algorithms for time-oriented data in Visual Analytics","body":"TimeBench, a flexible, easy-to-use, and reusable software library written in \r\nJava that provides foundational data structures and algorithms for time-\r\noriented data in Visual Analytics. Thus, it eases the development and testing \r\nof new visualization, interaction, and analysis methods. It facilitates the \r\nreuse and combination of such methods and fosters their reproducibility and \r\ncomparability.\r\n\r\nTimeBench is licensed under the terms of a BSD 2-clause license, and can be \r\nfreely used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes (see LICENSE).\r\n\r\nDEMO\r\n----\r\n\r\nThe source of several demo applications showing the library in use is included\r\nin the `demo/` directory. \r\n\r\nThe demos are also available via Java Web Start at\r\n(http://www.cvast.tuwien.ac.at/TimeBench).\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe library distribution uses the following organization:\r\n<pre>\r\n+ TimeBench\r\n|-- data   Data files used by the demo applications\r\n|-- demo   Demo applications showing the library in use\r\n|-- src    The source code for the TimeBench library\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n------------\r\n\r\nTimeBench is written in Java 1.6. To compile the TimeBench code, and to build \r\nand run Visual Analytics prototypes, you'll need a copy of the Java Development \r\nKit (JDK) for version 1.6 or greater. \r\n\r\nThe library depends on the following packages: \r\n- [prefuse](https://github.com/ieg-vienna/Prefuse), with some extensions\r\n- [Apache Commons Lang 3 classes](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/)\r\n- [Apache log4j 1.2](http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/)\r\n- [iCal4j 1.0.4](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ical4j/) \r\n- Java/R Interface (JRI), which is part of [rJava](http://www.rforge.net/rJava/)\r\n- [ieg-util](https://github.com/ieg-vienna/ieg-util), general Java utilities\r\n- [ieg-prefuse](https://github.com/ieg-vienna/ieg-prefuse), general prefuse extensions\r\n\r\nWe also recommended (though by no means is it required) that you use an\r\nIntegrated Development Environment such as Eclipse (http://eclipse.org).\r\nEspecially if you are a Java novice, it will likely make your life much easier.\r\n\r\nCitation\r\n--------\r\n\r\nRind, A.; Lammarsch, T.; Aigner, W.; Alsallakh, B. & Miksch, S.: \r\n[TimeBench: A Data Model and Software Library for Visual Analytics of Time-Oriented Data](http://www.ifs.tuwien.ac.at/~rind/preprint/rind_2013_vast_timebench.pdf), \r\n_IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics, Special Issue \"VIS 2013\",_ \r\nVol. 19, No. 12, forthcoming, 2013.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
